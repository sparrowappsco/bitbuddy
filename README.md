## Support

If you experience any issues concerning application functionality, try these troubleshooting tips.

**1. Information Not Loading**
   
   If your information isn't loading properly within Bit Buddy, try quitting the app and reopening it.

   To edit a previously saved device, tap into the device and press the "Edit" icon in the upper right corner. When pressed, a new view will appear, allowing for edits to the following information: Name, Capacity, Content Type, Color, Icon, Favorite status, and Network-Attached status. Location editing is not available to edit as of Version 1.1.0.

   When adding Additional Information in the detailed device view, the "Edit" button will change to a checkmark. This button, when pressed, will commit any information stored in the Additional Information field. New information added in this field will be saved automatically, however, deleting information will not. In order to save the deletion, users will need to press the checkmark button. This is due to the nature of the Additional Information field.

   Version 2.0 introduces cloud providers to the Settings. Cloud providers, when chosen, will populate in the third page of the Stats Widgets within the main device list. **If the cloud providers do not appear, or their links do not work, please perform a Secure Wipe and close the app entirely before trying again.**

   If the Stats Widget on your home screen doesn't display accurate statistics about your devices, try these steps: Firstly, quit the app and remove the widget, then reopen the app and re-add the widget. If this doesn't work, quit the app, remove the widget, restart your device, reopen the app, and then re-add the widget. If the issue still persists, you'll need to perform a Secure Wipe and re-enter your devices. We understand this process may be inconvenient, but it's necessary due to how information is stored within Bit Buddy. If the widget still isn't functioning correctly after attempting these steps, please use the 'Report a Bug' button in the app's Settings pane.

   **2. Appearance/Icon Switching**

   You can toggle between appearance modes in Bit Buddy. This is done by clicking '**Bit Buddy**' atop the Dashboard, clicking into the Appearance option, and selecting the color scheme. By default, Bit Buddy inherits the system setting (if your phone is in Dark Mode, Bit Buddy will be in Dark Mode).

   Bit Buddy features several alternate icons that **all** users can choose from. If you select an alternate icon and it doesn't update, please restart your device. This is believed to be a bug within the current verison of iOS. If restarting your device doesn't work, please use the "Report a Bug" button found in the Settings tab, or contact us directly at support@bitbuddyapp.co

   Navigating Bit Buddy is simple. In the Dashboard, there are three buttons along the top of the app. The graduation cap takes you to Tips, a list of curated guides to better manage your external devices. To the right is Sort, which allows you to personalize your list layout. The last button is 'Bit Buddy' at the top. Clicking this text will present users with Settings, and other useful features. To add a device, click the floating button along the bottom left of Bit Buddy's interface. If navigation does not work as expected, please quit the app (swipe up from multitasking), and reopen. If quitting Bit Buddy doesn't work, please use the "Report a Bug" button found in the Settings tab, or contact us directly at support@bitbuddyapp.co
   
**3. Biometric Authentication**
   
   If biometrics aren't working, go to the Settings tab within the app (toolbar) and uncheck the Biometrics toggle. Once the request goes through, try enabling Biometrics again by repressing the toggle. As of version 1.1.0 Bit Buddy locks **whenever** the user navigates away from the app (opens another app, goes to home screen/notification center, etc.).

   Bit Buddy uses your device's built-in biometric authentication capabilities (Face-ID/Touch-ID). If you want to disable Bit Buddy from being able to use any biometric data, go to your device's Settings app, scroll to Bit Buddy, and uncheck the toggle labled "Face-ID/Touch-ID."
   
**4. Secure Wipe**
   
   Secure Wipe works by refreshing the app state whenever the function is called. It is highly recommended the users quit the app once confirming their choice to remove all content. Upon restart of the app, all information will be erased.

   Should Bit Buddy be deleted or removed from your device all content will be erased. If you no longer like or need Bit Buddy, we recommend users perform a Secure Wipe prior to deletion to ensure that zero information remains stored on your device. 

  **5. Device Location**

Bit Buddy allows users to enter an address/location for each device. This location is only used to show the Map view found in the expanded device view (clicking into a saved device). This location information is not made available to Bit Buddy, nor is any information transmitted to Bit Buddy or its developer. Adding an address is optional and users will never be forced to add one.

  **6. Other Concerns/Issues**

  If none of the above steps helped with your specific problem, users can contact us at support@bitbuddyapp.co, or use the "Report a Bug" button within the Settings pane of Bit Buddy. All correspondence from Bit Buddy will come from a domain with '@bitbuddy.co' at the end.
