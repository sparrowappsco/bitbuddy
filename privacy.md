# Privacy Policy

### Last updated: November 22, 2024 @ 10:00 AM EST

Thank you for choosing Bit Buddy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our app. This privacy policy outlines the various ways Bit Buddy uses and protects your information.

## Overview

Bit Buddy (app) is developed, maintained, and updated by One Thirteen based in Delaware, United States. Bit Buddy does not contain any subscription plans or recurring charges.

## Personal Information

Information stored within Bit Buddy remains entirely on the user's (your) device. Information is never shared with us, One Thirteen, or Apple/App Store. Users are in complete control of the information stored within Bit Buddy. Users always have the option to remove their information, either on an item-by-item basis or by using the built-in "Secure Wipe" function. Deletion of Bit Buddy from your device will also remove all content stored within.

If you experience a crash, Apple may send device-related information to us, One Thirteen, to help better understand the cause of the crash and how to fix it. This information may include the device model, software (iOS/iPadOS) version, app version, the date and time, and the action that led to the crash.

## Privacy & Security

Bit Buddy, and the information stored within, live entirely on your device. There is no cloud or third-party storage connection.

Bit Buddy features the use of Biometric Authentication to prevent unauthorized access to your stored information. This Biometric Authentication relies on users being enrolled in Face/Touch-ID on their device. Bit Buddy does not have access to face or fingerprint scans. Users always have the option to revoke Biometric Authentication (labeled as Biometrics within Bit Buddy) on an app-level or system level. To remove all access to device biometrics, go to the Settings app on your device, scroll to Bit Buddy, and uncheck the toggle marked "Face/Touch-ID."

Bit Buddy uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymized usage data. This helps us understand how our users are using our app and how we can improve it. TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information. You can read more about TelemetryDeckâ€™s privacy policy at https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy

## Links

Bit Buddy may contain links to other websites within the Settings pane. Clicking on any of these links will open a third-party link. These websites are not operated by One Thirteen or Bit Buddy, and their privacy policies can be extremely different from those of One Thirteen/Bit Buddy. It is recommended that users familiarize themselves with the privacy policy of these websites.

Bit Buddy features several links that route users to their default mail application. When contacting One Thirteen/Bit Buddy, important app-related information such as device model, application version, software (iOS/iPadOS) version, and build number will be shared with One Thirteen. The user's email address will also be shared as the primary means of contact. All correspondence from One Thirteen/Bit Buddy will come from an email address ending in '@bitbuddyapp.co.'

Bit Buddy features links that route users to the Apple App Store. These links, when clicked, open a review form to allow users to easily leave a review of the current version of Bit Buddy. These reviews are made available to One Thirteen/Bit Buddy. One Thirteen is not notified when users click on the link from within the Settings tab.

## In-App Purchases

Bit Buddy contains in-app purchases that unlock additional features and functionality for a one-time purchase. In-app purchases are tied to your Apple ID and can be restored on any device that uses the same Apple ID. All purchases are processed through Apple and their payment system. One Thirteen is aware of when a purchase is made, but is not aware of who made the purchase. One Thirteen/Bit Buddy does not have access to any payment information.

## Changes to this Policy

This privacy policy may be updated. Users are strongly encouraged to frequently monitor changes made to this policy and the contents of it. The date listed at the top of this privacy policy will always show the date this policy has been updated. When applicable, a pop-up may appear within Bit Buddy to alert users of changes.
